In this project, we can manipulate our text into <strong>LowerCase to Uppercase</strong> or <strong>UpperCase To LowerCase</strong> or We are also able to remove <strong>extra spaces</strong>.<br> 
................................<br> 
With the help of this project, I learned about props, state, and components.<br>
In this project, We created two components i.e NavBar and TextArea<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>NavBar:</strong> In this component, I learned about props- how to create and pass the data through them. </li>
  <li><strong>TextArea:</strong> In this component, I learned about the state - How to create it and set the data dynamically.<br>(with the help of the state, we are manipulating the text given by the user and according to the user what operation he wants to perform)</li>
</ul>
